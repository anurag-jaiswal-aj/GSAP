GSAP Bootcamp - 8 Days of Animation Learning:<br>
Welcome to my GSAP Bootcamp repository! This project showcases my learning journey through an 8-day intensive bootcamp focused on mastering GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). <br>Each day is dedicated to exploring and implementing different animation techniques using GSAP, leading up to a final project where I applied all the skills learned to create a fully animated website.

Overview:<br>
This repository is organized by days, with each folder containing the project files for that day's lesson. Here’s a breakdown of what I covered each day:

Day 1: Creating Basic Animations<br>
Objective: Understand the fundamentals of GSAP and create simple animations.<br>
Key Concepts: Tween, easing, and basic properties.<br>
Outcome: Created animations like bouncing balls, moving squares, and fading text.<br>

Day 2: Using ScrollTrigger<br>
Objective: Learn how to trigger animations based on the scroll position.<br>
Key Concepts: ScrollTrigger, pinning, and progress-based animations.<br>
Outcome: Built sections that animate as they enter the viewport, like parallax effects and scroll-based transitions.<br>

Day 3: Creating Slick SVG Animations<br>
Objective: Animate SVG graphics to create visually appealing effects.<br>
Key Concepts: SVG paths, drawing, and morphing.<br>
Outcome: Developed animations where SVG elements draw themselves, change shapes, and transform dynamically.<br>

Day 4: Creating Cursor Animations<br>
Objective: Design custom cursor animations that react to user interactions.<br>
Key Concepts: Mouse tracking, custom cursor, and interactive effects.<br>
Outcome: Created a variety of cursor effects like expanding circles, following elements, and hover-based changes.<br>

Day 5: Creating Timeline Animations<br>
Objective: Use GSAP timelines to manage complex animations.<br>
Key Concepts: Timeline, sequencing, and synchronized animations.<br>
Outcome: Developed animations with multiple steps, like image galleries and step-by-step animations that trigger sequentially.<br>

Day 6: Creating Text Animations<br>
Objective: Animate text elements to create engaging visual effects.<br>
Key Concepts: Split text, text reveals, and typography animations.<br>
Outcome: Built text animations such as letter-by-letter reveals, typewriter effects, and text transformations.<br>

Day 7: Creating Scrolling Text Animations<br>
Objective: Implement scrolling text animations for dynamic content display.<br>
Key Concepts: Marquee effects, infinite scrolling, and text transitions.<br>
Outcome: Created animations where text scrolls continuously or reacts to user scroll input, like news tickers or auto-scrolling headlines.<br>

Day 8: Creating an Animated Website<br>
Objective: Integrate all learned skills to build a fully animated website.<br>
Key Concepts: Project integration, design consistency, and user experience.<br>
Outcome: Developed a comprehensive website featuring animated sections, interactive elements, and smooth transitions, demonstrating a practical application of GSAP animations.<br>

Technologies Used:<br>
HTML: Markup language for structuring content.<br>
CSS: Styling language for designing the visual layout.<br>
JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity.<br>
GSAP: GreenSock Animation Platform for creating complex animations.<br>

How to Use:<br>
1) Clone the repository:<br>
